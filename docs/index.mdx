Routemaster is a Flutter package that makes it easy to implement path-based routing.

It takes a path, such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/settings/wifi`
     
...and transforms it into a stack of pages, such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[HomePage(), SettingsPage(), WifiSettingsPage()]`.

Routemaster can be used to:

- Add support for URLs when using Flutter on web
- To add deep linking support on any platform
- Add easy path-based declarative navigation

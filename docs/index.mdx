Routemaster is a Flutter package that makes it easy to implement path-based routing. It takes a path, such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/settings/wifi`
     
...and transforms it into a stack of pages, such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[HomePage(), SettingsPage(), WifiSettingsPage()]`

It's ideal for supporting URLs on the web, and easily supporting deep linking.

# Features

* Simple declarative routing with an easy-to-use API
* Incredibly easy support for tabs and nested navigation
* Multiple route maps: for example one for a logged in user, another for logged out
* Observers to easily listen to route changes
* Covered by over 160 unit, widget and integration tests

Here's the *entire* routing setup needed for an app featuring tabs and pushed routes:


```dart
final routes = RouteMap(
  routes: {
    '/': (_) => CupertinoTabPage(
          child: HomePage(),
          paths: ['/feed', '/settings'],
        ),

    '/feed': (_) => MaterialPage(child: FeedPage()),
    '/settings': (_) => MaterialPage(child: SettingsPage()),
    '/feed/profile/:id': (info) => MaterialPage(
      child: ProfilePage(id: info.pathParameters['id'])
    ),
  }
);

void main() {
  runApp(
      MaterialApp.router(
        routerDelegate: RoutemasterDelegate(routesBuilder: (context) => routes),
        routeInformationParser: RoutemasterParser(),
      ),
  );
}
```
